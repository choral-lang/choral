# Choral

The source code of the Choral programming language. See [https://choral-lang.org/](https://choral-lang.org/).

To build the project locally, install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and run

```shell
mvn clean install
```

This will generate `dist/choral.jar`, which can be run with
```shell
java -jar ./dist/choral.jar
```
