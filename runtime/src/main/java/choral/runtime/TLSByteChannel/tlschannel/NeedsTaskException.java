/**
 * This exception signals the caller that the operation could not continue
 * because a CPU-intensive operation (typically a TLS handshaking) needs to be
 * executed and the {@link TlsChannel} is configured to not run tasks.
 * This allows the application to run these tasks in some other threads, in
 * order to not slow the selection loop. The method that threw the exception
 * should be retried once the task supplied by {@link #getTask()} is executed
 * and finished.
 * <p>
 * This exception is akin to the SSL_ERROR_WANT_ASYNC error code used by OpenSSL
 * (but note that in OpenSSL, the task is executed by the library, while with
 * the {@link TlsChannel}, the calling code is responsible for the
 * execution).
 *
 * @see <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_get_error.html">
 * OpenSSL error documentation</a>
